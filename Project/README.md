# Smart Parking Solution

## Overview
The Smart Parking Solution project is an innovative approach to addressing urban parking challenges. By utilizing IoT technology, real-time data analysis, and an intuitive user interface, this solution aims to optimize parking availability, reduce congestion, and improve user experience. The system integrates hardware (sensors and digital signage) and software (web and mobile platforms) to provide real-time updates, reservations, and dynamic pricing for parking slots.

The project is structured into multiple phases, starting from Project Initiation and Planning to Design, Development, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase includes clear deliverables, milestones, and resource allocations, ensuring the timely and efficient execution of the project.
